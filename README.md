# Shader Cache Cleaner

## Overview

This Python script is designed to clean up shader cache files from known locations on a Windows 11 machine. Shader cache files are temporary files generated by graphics drivers and game engines to improve performance by caching shader data.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Run the Script**:
    - Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
    - Navigate to the directory where the script (`remove_shader_cache.py`) is saved using the `cd` command.
    - Run the script by typing `python remove_shader_cache.py`.

4. **Review Output**: The script will delete shader cache files from various known locations on your system. Review the Command Prompt window output to ensure all cache files were removed successfully.

## Supported Locations

The script removes shader cache files from the following known locations:

- NVIDIA DXCache
- NVIDIA GLCache
- AMD DxCache
- Unreal Engine ShaderCache
- Unity Caches
- DirectX Shader Cache
- NVIDIA Temp Cache
- DirectX Temp Cache
- DirectX Shader Temp Cache
- AMD Temp GL Cache
- Unreal Engine Derived Data Cache
- Unity Asset Store Cache
- .NET CLR Cache
- Additional NVIDIA NV_Cache Locations

## Note

- Running this script will permanently delete files in the specified directories. Ensure you understand the impact of this action, especially if you're running it on a system where the shader cache might be needed.
- Run the script with administrative privileges to ensure all cache files can be deleted.
